# Alumni-Meet

## 📌 Overview

The **Alumni-Meet** is a centralized web-based system designed to strengthen the connection between colleges and their alumni. It replaces scattered communication channels (emails, messaging groups, manual records) with a single, structured platform for networking, events, mentorship, and institutional collaboration.

This platform enables seamless interaction between **students, alumni, administrators, and faculty**, fostering long-term engagement and community growth.
